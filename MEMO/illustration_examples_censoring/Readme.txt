This folder and its subfolders contain the routines 
for the case study on artificial censored data.

- ./interval_censoring: routines used for study shown in Figure 1 of the manuscrpt
- ./right censoring: routines used for study in Figure 2 of the manuscript
- ./Lee_Scott_right_censoring: routines used for study in Supplementary Material Section S.7
    To use this code you have to download the Matlab code for the algorithm published in the following paper
