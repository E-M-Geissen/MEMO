  "body": "![MEMO](MEMO/figs/MEMO_v9.png)\r\n \r\n## Features\r\nMEMO is an easy to use software toolbox for the statistical analysis of uncensored and censored single cell data. It can deal with a variety of data types. The subpopulation structure and statistical properties of heterogeneous\r\ncell populations are assessed by the application of maximum likelihood inference and hypothesis testing to mixture models. MEMOs key features are\r\n* support of uncensored, interval and right censored data,\r\n* symbolic definition and compilation of the mixture models,\r\n* support of normal, log-normal, gamma and Johnson-SU distributions, \r\n* integration and simultaneous analysis of multiple experimental conditions,\r\n* provision of gradient information for multi-start local optimization,\r\n* automated backward model selection,\r\n* integration of identifiability and uncertainty analysis (profile likelihoods and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods) using PESTO.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nMEMO is a software package for MATLAB. To exploit its functionality the [Optimization Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/optimization/), the [Symbolic Math Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic/) and the [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox] (http://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics/) are required. For parameter estimation the MATLAB toolbox [PESTO] (http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/research/groups/data-driven-computational-modelling/staff/ma/2519/index.html) is required. For MCMC sampling the MATLAB toolbox [DRAM] (http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/mcmc/) is required.\r\n\r\n## Citation\r\nIf you use this toolbox in a publication, please cite the following manuscript:\r\n\r\nGeissen, E.-M., Hasenauer, J., Heinrich, S., Hauf, S., Teis, F.
